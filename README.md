This is an R-shiny interface for the statnet suite of R packages. It currently incorporates functionality from the ergm, network and sna packages, allowing users to explore, fit and assess exponential random graph models via a simple GUI.

The app can be run in two ways:  

* Through the shinyapps server with this link:   https://statnet.shinyapps.io/statnetWeb  

* On your local machine using the statnetWeb R package:
```r
install.packages("statnetWeb")
statnetWeb::run_sw()
```
